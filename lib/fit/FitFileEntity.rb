  # The FIT file is a generic container for all kinds of data. This could be
  # activity data, config files, workout definitions, etc. All data is stored
  # in FIT message records. Also the information what kind of FIT file this is
  # is stored in such a record. When we start reading the file, we actually
  # don't know what kind of file it is until we find the right record to tell
  # us. Since we already need to have gathered some information at this point,
  # we use this utility class to store the read data until we know what Ruby
  # objec we need to use to store it for later consumption.
